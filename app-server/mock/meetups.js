        description:
            "This is a kayaking tour in beautiful nature which is a bit more on the adventurous side. We start our tour in the small town of Rheinsberg, about 90km north of Berlin, where we pass by a picturesque rococo castle in our kayaks. What starts out as a leisurely and undemanding boat ride soon becomes a bit more sporty as the current is getting stronger the further we get with our kayaks. The second half of the route is the wildest part. The narrow and shallow Rhin stream winds through high forests and wetlands. From time to time we need to dodge fallen trees and floating trunks. Though we use our paddles for steering our kayaks we let ourselves drift with the current for the most part. That said, the tour is not very strenuous from a stamina standpoint. All in all, this tour is also suited for beginners and does not require previous experience with kayaks.",
